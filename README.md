random-dril-tweet
=================

Gets a random [@dril](https://twitter.com/dril) tweet so you can more easily view the great man's wisdom.

Use by the following steps:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) if you haven't already.
2. `git clone` the project.
3. `cargo build` the project.
4. Add a line calling the executable to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`.

**A warning**: A lot of @dril's tweets are extremely bizarre, and use words considered "Nasty" and "Rude". If someone yells at you for using this on a work device, that's your own fault.
